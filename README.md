# Car-Parking-Guide
Jio Artificial Intelligence Hackathon 2K19

The main usage of this project is to develop a Smart Parking system that typically obtains
information about available parking spaces in a particular geographic area and process is
real-time to place vehicles at available parking spots.

The main advantage of implementing this project is by deployed as a system, smart parking thus
reduces car emissions in urban centers by reducing the need for people to needlessly circle city
blocks searching for parking. It also permits cities to carefully manage their parking supply and
finally, it reduces the daily stress associated with parking woes.
